# Vet Finder

This is Team "Git Fetch" project submission for Chewy Diversity Hackathon 2023!

Note: due of the time constraint, we primarily focused on this site being viewed from a mobile device. This is because we projected that most users will be viewing Vet Finder from their phone, in case of emergencies or for ease of use. 
# To start the app,
`cd vet-finder-app`

`npm start`
